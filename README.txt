R machine learning workflow using Caret and Random Forest library.

Stepwise processing methods for data modeling. 
The workflow includes data preparation, algorithm selection, training model and a test of final model.

Prediction improvement made by using Random Forest method. 
But there is still room for model improvement by studying and introducing more business domain related data, such as weather condition data etc.
